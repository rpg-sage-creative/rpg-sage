RPG Sage - A TTRPG Play by Discord bot (primarily PF2e)

This code represents the RPG Sage, a Discord Bot designed for Play by Discord usage.
While originally written specific to Pathfinder 2e, the core dialog and dice functionality allow for any TTRPG.

## Dev Setup

For transparency, and to ensure compatibility, the following versions are used:
- The Dev Lab: use VSCode, NVM 0.39.7, Node 18.20.2, and Typescript 5.4.5
- The Server: NVM 0.39.7, Node 18.15.0, and Typescript 5.1.6

The tasks.json file's build task includes a dependency that creates an index.d.ts for pdf2json ... mind it!
