			"body": "Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons. For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.\n\n**Key Ability: DEXTERITY**\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability bonus to Dexterity.\n\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier**\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\n\n#### Key Terms\nYou'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. \n\n**Finisher**: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. \n\n**Flourish**: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. \n\n**Stance**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\n\n#### Roleplaying the Swashbuckler\n\n\n#### During Combat Encounters...\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them.\n\n#### During Social Encounters...\nYou are equally likely to charm or intimidate others-or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.\n\n#### While Exploring...\nYou keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.\n\n#### In Downtime...\nYou might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.\n\n#### You Might...\n+ Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present.\n+ Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.\n+ Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.\n\n#### Others Probably...\n+ Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.\n+ Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.\n+ Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.\n\n#### Initial Proficiencies\nAt 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.\n\n#### Perception\nExpert in Perception\n\n#### Saving Throws\nTrained in Fortitude\nExpert in Reflex\nExpert in Will\n\n#### Skills\nTrained in Acrobatics\nTrained in one skill determined by your swashbuckler's style\nTrained in a number of additional skills equal to 4 plus your Intelligence modifier\n\n#### Attacks\nTrained in simple weapons\nTrained in martial weapons\nTrained in unarmed attacks\n\n#### Defenses\nTrained in light armor\nTrained in unarmored defense\n\n#### Class DC\nTrained in swashbuckler class DC\n\n#### Class Features\nYou gain these features as a Swashbuckler. Abilities gained at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to the features' names.\n**Your Level** | **Class Features**\n--- | ---\n1 | Ancestry and background, initial proficiencies, panache, swashbuckler's style, precise strike (2d6), confident finisher, swashbuckler feat\n2 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n3 | General feat, great fortitude, opportune riposte, skill increase, stylish trick, vivacious speed +10 feet\n4 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n5 | Ability boosts, ancestry feat, precise strike (3d6), skill increase, weapon expertise\n6 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n7 | Evasion, general feat, skill increase, stylish trick, vivacious speed +15 feet, weapon specialization\n8 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n9 | Ancestry feat, exemplary finisher, precise strike (4d6), skill increase, swashbuckler expertise\n10 | Ability boosts, skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n11 | Continuous flair, general feat, skill increase, vigilant senses, vivacious speed +20 feet\n12 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n13 | Ancestry feat, improved evasion, light armor expertise, precise strike (5d6), skill increase, weapon mastery\n14 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n15 | Ability boosts, general feat, greater weapon specialization, keen flair, skill increase, stylish trick, vivacious speed +25 feet\n16 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n17 | Ancestry feat, precise strike (6d6), resolve, skill increase\n18 | Skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n19 | Eternal confidence, general feat, light armor mastery, skill increase, vivacious speed +30 feet\n20 | Ability boosts, skill feat, swashbuckler feat\n\n#### Ancestry and Background\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\n\n#### Confident Finisher\nYou gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache. You gain the Confident Finisher action.\n\n#### Confident Finisher\nYou make an incredibly graceful attack, piercing your foe's defenses. Make a Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack that would apply your precise strike damage, with the following failure effect.\n\n**Failure** You deal half your precise strike damage to the target. This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you used for the Strike.\n\n#### Initial Proficiencies\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\n\n#### Panache\nYou care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular bravado, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and you are either in a state of panache or you are not.\n\nYou gain panache by successfully performing the skill check associated with specific actions that have a bit of flair, including Tumble Through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style. At the GM's discretion, after succeeding at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a different threshold).\n\nWhile you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature also causes you to deal extra precision damage while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. \n\nNormally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.\n\n#### Precise Strike\nYou strike with flair. When you have panache and you Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.\n\nAs your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. Increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike and the number of additional dice on a finisher by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.\n\n#### Swashbuckler Feats\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat.\n\n#### Swashbuckler's Style\nAs a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-or- death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler's style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here.\n\n#### Skill Feats (2nd)\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\n\n#### General Feats (3rd)\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\n\n#### Great Fortitude (3rd)\nYour physique is incredibly hardy, granting you increased endurance. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\n\n#### Opportune Riposte (3rd)\nYou turn the tables on foes who fumble, capitalizing immediately on their mistake. You gain the Opportune Riposte reaction.\n\n#### Opportune Riposte\nYou take advantage of an opening from your enemy's fumbled attack. You either make a melee Strike against the triggering foe or attempt to Disarm it of the weapon it used for the Strike.\n\n#### Skill Increases (3rd)\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\nAt 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\n\n#### Stylish Tricks (3rd)\nAt 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler's style.\n\n#### Vivacious Speed (3rd)\nWhen you've made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don't have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.\n\n#### Ability Boosts (5th)\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.\n\n#### Ancestry Feats (5th)\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\n\n#### Weapon Expertise (5th)\nYou've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.\n\n#### Evasion (7th)\nYou've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\n\n#### Weapon Specialization (7th)\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\n\n#### Exemplary Finisher (9th)\nYou execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style. \n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found here.\n\n#### Swashbuckler Expertise (9th)\nYou perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.\n\n#### Continuous Flair (11th)\nWhile not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation. Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.\n\n#### Vigilant Senses (11th)\nThrough your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\n\n#### Improved Evasion (13th)\nYour ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary.

When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.\n\n#### Resolve (17th)\nYou've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\n\n#### Eternal Confidence (19th)\nAs a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC increases to master.\n\nWhen you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from Precise Finisher if you have that feat. You can do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack that you could use for Confident Finisher.\n\n#### Light Armor Mastery (19th)\nYour skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.",
