/*
map image caching to be done here
> getMapImageCacheRoot()/user_snowflake/map_snowflake/image_snowflake

by default, cache one map per user during render: "generic cache"

each map render triggers:
1- get map owner cache status
 1a- how many maps can they cache
2- clear oldest cache to make room for
